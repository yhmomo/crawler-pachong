In 5G, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can function as relays, and flying base stations to enhance communication availability and meet user demands across a wide range of applications. However, these advancements also bring security threats and malicious activities aimed at disrupting the communication system. One such threat is the Depletion of Battery (DoB) attack. Battery life is a critical component for UAVs, and attackers may attempt to deplete it in various ways, either through physical contact or remotely. Remote attacks can occur via GPS data channels or control channels, with the latter being particularly dangerous. In this work, we focus on an attack using Packet Forwarding Control Protocol (PFCP) messages. These messages are of high priority, requiring immediate attention from the UAV, which attackers exploit to drain the battery by sending numerous unauthorized PFCP messages. To address this attack, we have implemented the CUMSUM method for detection, taking into account the attack vector as a combination of energy consumption, battery depletion, and time. To further enhance our detection approach, we have developed a dynamic threshold strategy to minimize the false positive rate, making our solution more robust and reliable."

Toward such a system, we discuss the development of two components: ROS GPS waypoint tracking package and centralized task allocation network system (CTANS). The ROS GPS waypoint tracking package is the first open source software developed for the AR Drone 2.0 UAV that enables integration with a larger system. CTANS connects the UAV host computers to a central computer, receives the UAV status information and distributes GPS flight directives. CTANS is responsible for distributing the commands to the UAVs to ensure mission handoffs are conducted as required. This multi-UAV control software testbed was used to implement a small scale, outdoor, persistent, GPS based patrol mission with two UAVs."

It is an indispensable component for a UAV as it provides accurate location data that is critical for navigation and mission success. However, GPS spoofing attacks are becoming a growing threat to GPS-dependent systems. Most existing GPS spoofing detection methods for UAVs are proposed based on simulation data or depend on multiple UAVs. In this paper, we propose a signal feature-based GPS spoofing detection approach, SigFeaDet, for a UAV using machine learning techniques. Our basic idea is to use the anomalies of GPS signal features due to the discrepancy between normal and spoofing signals. The Carrier-to-Noise Density Ratio (CN0) and Doppler frequency are significant signal features for GPS satellite positioning, which can be applied to identify spoofing signals. Various machine learning algorithms are applied to train with normal and spoofing data to choose the best classifier. The open GPS dataset TEXBAT is processed to obtain signal data and we also perform flight experiments to collect GPS data to augment normal GPS signal dataset. The detection rate is more than 94.8% and the equal error rate (EER) is about 5%, and the detection period is only 0.4 second."
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10731827/,Isolation Forest Algorithm Against UAV’s GPS Spoofing Attack,"Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms are a valuable source of data for inspection, surveillance, mapping, and 3D modeling issues. Embedded electronic and communication systems within UAVs are based on the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) into UAV systems (commonly called the Internet of Drone Things (IoDT)). Nevertheless, the vulnerability of this interconnected environment to malicious activities, such as GPS spoofing, threatens the dependability and security of UAV operations. To countermeasure this challenging issue, this article uses an effective anomaly detection method, the Isolation Forest algorithm, for mitigating GPS spoofing threats. A well-curated dataset specifically targeting the detection of GPS deception in UAVs has been utilized. Extensive experiments were conducted to compare our proposal with its counterparts (Random Forest and Naive Bayes). The experimental outcomes demonstrate the Isolation Forest algorithm’s efficiency in anomaly detection, attaining a noteworthy accuracy rate of (95.85%). However, Random Forest and Naive Bayes achieved (93.63%) and (92.38%), respectively. Other performance evaluation metrics show that the Isolation Forest works better than others, which supports its potential as a reliable way for anomaly detection when GPS spoofing happens in UAVs. The insight obtained from this research can provide valuable input for creating proactive security protocols to guarantee the secure implementation and functioning of UAVs."

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10049031/,UAVs Reformation Approach Based on Packet Loss in GPS-Denied Environments,"Drone technology, which is employed by a large number of industries and institutions, including the military and commercial, makes use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) to precisely pinpoint locations and has given a huge rise in aerial surveillance applications. Though drones without GPS can still be operated, there is no certainty that the locations are precise due to a lack of real-time position information and existing environmental influences. In this paper, we perform network packet transmission over a drone swarm to relocate imprecise positions of formation when GPS is unavailable. We introduce a reformation approach based on packet loss, which relocates the drone swarm’s formation into the initially intended one to preserve the original coverage area as much as possible. Through simulations, we show that our proposed approach guarantees to acquire the lost coverage area by improving inaccurate formation within a reasonable period of time. Although the adjusted formation is not exactly as originally desired in some cases, the coverage area is still higher obtained than the imprecise one."
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10166080/,Autonomous Patrol Technology and System on Leapfrog-Type Charging UAV-Automatic Positioning of UAV Based on GPS/RTK,"In order to solve the problem of endurance in the process of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) line patrol, an autonomous UAV line patrol system based on leapfrog charging is designed and implemented. The key to achieving the goal of autonomous line patrol for UAVs is autonomous positioning technology and automatic charging control technology. This paper focuses on the research of autonomous positioning technology for UAVs based on GPS/RTK. First of all, the system structure and operating principle of leapfrog-type charging UAV is proposed, and the combined GPS/RTK navigation control module and automatic identification module are developed. Then, in order to ensure that the UAVs can precise positioning, accurate calibration of cameras and targets are studied. Finally, this paper conducts experimental simulations in the three main links of attitude solving, acceleration compensation and delay compensation in line patrol technology. The experimental results show that the attitude solving algorithm can accurately estimate the flight attitude of the UAVs in flight, and can compensate for the motion acceleration in a timely and fast manner. The delay compensation algorithm can effectively solve the problem of positioning sensor delay. When the barometer output altitude data is unhealthy, the system can identify the health of the data and automatically fuse the altitude data output by GPS. Therefore, the methods and research conclusions proposed in this paper have important engineering guiding significance for the autonomous line patrol of UAVs."
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5747587/,Battery health management system for electric UAVs,"This paper presents a novel battery health management system for electric UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) based on a Bayesian inference driven prognostic framework. The aim is to be able to predict the end-of-discharge (EOD) event that indicates that the battery pack has run out of charge for any given flight of an electric UAV platform. The amount of usable charge of a battery for a given discharge profile is not only dependent on the starting state-of-charge (SOC), but also other factors like battery health and the discharge or load profile imposed. This problem is more pronounced in battery powered electric UAVs since different flight regimes like takeoff/landing and cruise have different power requirements and a dead stick condition (battery shut off in flight) can have catastrophic consequences. Since UAVs deployments are relatively new, there is a lack of statistically significant flight data to motivate data-driven approaches. Consequently, we have developed a detailed discharge model for the batteries used and used it in a Bayesian inference based filtering (Particle Filtering) technique to generate remaining useful life (RUL) distributions for a given discharge. The results section presents the validation of this approach in hardware-in-the-loop tests."
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7558950/,Design of wireless power transfer device for UAV,"In recent years, research on wireless power transmission (WPT) technologies has been attracting more attention after MIT introduced the magnetic resonance technology in 2007. Wireless magnetic resonant power transfer is an emerging technology that has many advantages over other wireless power transfer methods due to its safety and flexible comfortable supplying energy needs to electric devices. At the same time, with the constant improvement and extension application rang of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the main problem of the UAV is that it cannot carry out remote tasks because of its weak cruising ability. In this paper, we develop a wireless magnetic resonant power transfer system that enables UAVs to provide power to, and which can solve the problem of UAV's endurance."
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10154998/,GPS-Spoofing Attack Detection Mechanism for UAV Swarms,"Recently autonomous and semi-autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms started to receive a lot of research interest and demand from various civil application fields. However, for a successful mission execution UAV swarms require Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals and in particular Global Positioning System (GPS) signals for navigation. Unfortunately, civil GPS signals are unencrypted and unauthenticated, which facilitates the execution of GPS spoofing attacks. During these attacks adversaries mimic the authentic GPS signal and broadcast it to the targeted UAV in order to change its course, force it to land or crash. In this study, we propose a GPS spoofing detection mechanism capable of detecting single-transmitter and multi-transmitter GPS spoofing attacks to prevent the above mentioned outcomes. Our detection mechanism is based on comparing the distance between each two swarm members calculated from their GPS coordinates to the distance acquired from Impulse Radio Ultra-Wideband ranging between the same swarm members. If the difference in distances is larger than a chosen threshold the GPS spoofing attack is declared detected."
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9333971/,Large-term sensing system for agriculture utilizing UAV and wireless power transfer,"In recent years, in order to improve crop production and quality of agricultural operations, an “agricultural remote monitoring system” have been attracting a lot of attention. The existing studies have proposed an agricultural remote monitoring systems using Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). In the existing system, the environmental information is collected from a large number of sensor nodes installed in the farm using a low-power wireless communications (e.g., ZigBee, LPWA). However, in these systems, even when the low-power wireless technology is utilized, it is difficult to run permanently on batteries because the battery capacity is not infinity. In addition, in the case of a large-scale field, a large number of intermediate nodes should be installed in the field, hence the installation and operation costs are high.On the other hand, a wireless power transfer technology is evolving and equipment which is capable of supplying power to places dozens of centimeters away has been available. In addition, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) that can fly stably for a long time and has a large loading capacity has appeared.Therefore, in this study, we propose and develop a wide-area sensing system for large-scale farms using a UAV, a wireless power transfer technology, and an energy-saving short-range wireless communication system (i.e., Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)). The UAV flies autonomously to the location of sensor nodes that are widely installed in the large farm for collecting the sensor data. Here, the UAV is designed to supply the power to the sensor node to measure and send the environmental information using the wireless power transfer technology. It eliminates the need for periodic battery replacement of the sensor node, which reduces the cost of operating the system.Through the experimental evaluation using the developed system, it has been confirmed that the UAV can accurately be controlled by the proposed feedback control to land near the sensor nodes, and that the sensor nodes can be operated by the wireless power transfer from the embedded system of the UAV."

The GPS spoofing is a prominent security threat of UAVs. In this paper, we propose a 5G-assisted UAV position monitoring and anti-GPS spoofing system that allows live detection of GPS spoofing by leveraging Uplink received signal strength (RSS) measurements to cross-check the position validity. We introduce the Adaptive Trustable Residence Area (ATRA); a novel strategy to determine the trust area within which the UAV's GPS position should be located in order to be considered as non-spoofed. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed solution can successfully detect spoofed GPS positions with a rate of above 95%."
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10200557/,Graphic Neural Network based GPS Spoofing Detection for Cellular-Connected UAV swarm,"The cellular-connected Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as integral components of the 5G and beyond system due to their mobility and flexibility. Compared to a traditional single UAV, a flock of UAVs established as a UAV swarm can implement diverse distributed applications economically and efficiently, such as cooperatively smart agriculture, joint search and rescue, and supplementing temporary network connections. However, the GPS spoofing attack can manipulate UAV swarm locations and distort UAV swarm topology, which threatens the security of swarm communication and control. This paper proposes a Graphic Neural Networks (GNN) based GPS spoofing detection approach for cellular-connected UAV swarms. Especially, we propose a system in which the GNN model is used to detect GPS spoofing attacks by analyzing the similarity between the swarm GPS topology and communications topology. To evaluate the proposed neural networks, we use a bipartite graph and Hungarian algorithm to build a UAV swarm simulator. The results show that GNN can efficiently compute topologies’ similarity and detect GPS spoofing attacks. For instance, for a UAV swarm consisting of 10 UAVs, GNN detects the spoofing with accuracy over 90% and computation time of fewer than 10 milliseconds using Intel Core 1.6 GHz processor."
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10556988/,Enhancing Battery Efficiency Through Semi-Markov Decision Processes in Task Allocation for UAVs,"This research introduces a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) approach to task allocation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) by considering the stochastic behavior of battery levels. The SMDP allows the UAV to dynamically allocate tasks based on its current battery state and the time spent in each state. We compare the SMDP method with a manually assigned task sequence and demonstrate a significant reduction in completion time for a set of predefined tasks. The SMDP optimally assigns tasks, considering the stochastic nature of battery levels, resulting in improved efficiency and eliminating uncertainties associated with human allocation. The findings underscore the benefits of incorporating SMDP in UAV task management, especially in scenarios dependent on real-time battery levels."
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10131729/,GPS Spoofing Detection in UAV Using Motion Processing Unit,"To facilitate navigation and tracking, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) or drones rely on the global positioning system (GPS). Still, unmanned aerial vehicles are resistless to GPS spoofing attacks, which involve manipulating GPS module receivers by transmitting altered signals. For example, an adversary using an adverse GPS simulator could broadcast counterfeit GPS signals, causing a GPS-reliant UAV to deviate from its intended flight path. This can result in loss of position accuracy and potentially cause a crash or unauthorized access to restricted areas. To mitigate this issue, several approaches have been advocated to detect GPS spoofing attacks. Motion Processing Units (MPUs) have emerged as a promising option, as they can provide precise measurements of the UAVs orientation and movement, enabling the mitigation and detection of spoofing attacks on GPS signals. In this study, a technique is introduced for identifying and counteracting GPS spoofing attacks in drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using data from the MPU9250. The approach employs data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer along all three axes to detect instances of GPS spoofing and recover accurate GPS coordinates. Any noteworthy divergence in the gyroscope readings is considered as a possible GPS spoofing attack. To evaluate the efficacy of the propounded method, it is tested using real-world experiments, which demonstrate its capability to successfully detect falsified GPS signals."
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9824124/,Transfer Learning based GPS Spoofing Detection for Cellular-Connected UAVs,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are set to become an integral part of 5G and beyond systems with the promise of assisting cellular communications and enabling advanced applications and services, such as public safety, caching, and virtual/mixed reality-based remote inspection. However, safe and secure navigation of UAVs is a key requisite for their integration in the airspace. The GPS spoofing is one of the major security threats to remotely and autonomously controlled UAVs. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based, mobile network-assisted UAV monitoring and control system that allows live monitoring of UAVs' locations and intelligent detection of spoofed positions. We introduce the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in the edge UAV Flight Controller (UFC) to locate a UAV and detect any GPS spoofing by comparing differences between the theoretical path loss computed by UFC and the corresponding path loss reported by the connected base station (BS). To reduce the detection latency as well as to increase the detection accuracy, transfer learning is leveraged to transfer the CNN knowledge between edge servers when the UAV handovers from one BS to another. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed solution can successfully detect spoofed GPS positions with an accuracy rate above 88% using only one BS."

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8288496/,A Vision-Based GPS-Spoofing Detection Method for Small UAVs,"In recent years, consumer-class UAVs have come into public view and cyber security starts to attract the attention of researchers and hackers. The tasks of positioning, navigation and return-to-home (RTH) of UAV heavily depend on GPS. However, the signal structure of civil GPS used by UAVs is completely open and unencrypted, and the signal received by ground devices is very weak. As a result, GPS signals are vulnerable to jamming and spoofing. The development of software define radio (SDR) has made GPS-spoofing easy and costless. GPS-spoofing may cause UAVs to be out of control or even hijacked. In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect GPS-spoofing based on monocular camera and IMU sensor of UAV. Our method was demonstrated on the UAV of DJI Phantom 4."
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000335/,The Effects of Jamming on Global Positioning System (GPS) Accuracy for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs),"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are vulnerable to a number of threats, including jamming. Jamming is the act of intentionally directing electromagnetic energy towards a communication and / or navigation system to disrupt or prevent signal transmission and reception. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) jammers transmit interference signals in the frequency band used for satellite navigation. Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) filter as a potential solution to mitigate the jamming activity. The effectiveness of FSS depends on the incidence angle of the jamming signals. It is important to characterize the GPS performance of the UAV in the absence of the FSS filter, which will be used as a benchmark for modelling the appropriate FSS filter. Hence, this paper aims to investigate preliminary effects of jamming signal on UAV. The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of Global Positioning System (GPS) jamming on UAVs based on two different conditions, namely, varying times and rotation angles. The study was conducted using GPS simulation in an anechoic chamber to prevent external interferences and multipath. Different estimated probable error (EPE) patterns are observed at different times due to the GPS satellite constellation being dynamic. This indicates that GPS accuracy is time-dependent. The results also show that the presence of a jammer imposes a significant effect on GPS accuracy when the jammer signal reaches -89 dBm. The significance of this work is to provide a solution to prevent GPS jamming and ensure safe and reliable UAV navigation by using a frequency selective surface (FSS) filter for future work."

The system combines the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture with stereo vision cameras (OAK-D Lite), a Raspberry Pi computer, and a flight controller unit (Pixhawk-Cube). Navigating safely through obstacles becomes challenging for UAVs in GPS-denied environments. To address this issue, the drone is configured in altitude hold mode, and the system is trained on the Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset, enabling it to recognize objects and analyze the surrounding areas to identify free spaces. By doing so, the drone can traverse an obstacle-free path. The detected obstacle information is then utilized to generate avoidance trajectories, allowing the UAV to navigate around obstacles safely.

Typically evaluated under laboratory conditions by analyzing the 10 MHz and 1 pulse per second (PPS) reference signal stability, these test methods overlook airborne oscillator performance. This paper characterizes lightweight GNSSDO models for flight suitability using a measurement system based on software defined radios (SDRs). We analyze reference signal stability under controlled GNSS signal impairments to predict performance and measurement precision loss in dynamic operational modes. Additionally, we assess behavior under the impacts caused by operating the UAV, as well as typical flight vibrations and accelerations outlined in the standard for payload devices."
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6616189/,Distributed task allocation and coordination scheme for a multi-UAV sensor network,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks require successful mission execution, which is dependent on task planning and control. In this paper, we propose a distributed task allocation algorithm for a multi-UAV sensor network for sensing thorium intensities in the coastal areas of India. A power-aware coordination and planning approach is used to coordinate the activities of multiple UAVs. Depending on the availability of resources in each sensing UAV unit, each UAV initiates a task-scheduling algorithm and distributes its remaining tasks dynamically to other UAVs. The control station sends control information to the UAVs and receives the sensed parameters along with the location information from each UAV. The task allocation algorithm was simulated successfully using a network of static motes. The network was more effective and efficient with the use of this task allocation algorithm, thus contributing to improved mission execution in UAV networks."

The system reduces human intervention to the minimum, revolutionizing the affordability of a broad range of surveillance and data collection operations. The MUGs are equipped with a small Variable Buoyancy System (VBS) composed of a gas filled piston and a linear actuator powered by brushless DC motor and a rechargable lithium ion battery in an oil filled flexible enclosure. By using a fully pressure tolerant electronic design the aim is to reduce the total complexity, weight, and cost of the overall system. A first prototype of the VBS was built and demonstrated in a small aquarium. The electronic components were tested in a pressure testing facility to a minimum of 20bar.

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10873900/,An Analysis on the Energy Consumption of Coverage Path Planning Algorithms on Multiple UAVs,"One of the greatest limitations that aerial vehicles face nowadays is the limitation in flight durations. This issue becomes more critical in search applications where a specific area is required to be covered through drone using Coverage Path Planning (CPP) algorithms. Searching in bigger regions multiple drones are often deployed to cover an area. This work utilized multiple combinations of UAVs using different CPP algorithms to find the most optimal choice to cover a region. There were four simulation scenarios with the above-mentioned combinations which were evaluated for multiple parameters. These parameters include coverage completeness, coverage time, battery consumption and the number of maneuvers required to cover the region using ROS Gazebo Simulation and Qground Control. The data retrieved from the simulation results were then compared to determine the best CPP method. It was observed from the results that the Expanding Spiral method proved to be the fastest CPP method with the least coverage time, lowest battery consumption and least number of turns."
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8927929/,Efficient Data Collection in Large-Scale UAV-aided Wireless Sensor Networks,"Dispatching unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect sensor data from distributed sensor networks is expected to significantly improve the data collection efficiency of traditional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In this paper, we consider data collection for distributed large-scale UAV-aided WSNs. We first divide the target area into clusters, and determine the cluster head election and data forwarding rules within the cluster based on the value of information (VoI) and power of nodes. Then sensor nodes collect information around by event-driven, and the UAV acts as a mobile sink to collect the data of cluster head nodes. The direct future prediction (DFP) model is used to plan the UAV path, which allows the UAV to handle multitarget tasks, maximizing the total VoI collected while ensuring that the UAV is charged at low power. Simulation results show that our DFP model is superior to traditional Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) in performance."
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10027832/,Are UAVs' Flight Controller Software Reliable?,"Unmanned Ariel Vehicles (UAVs) are recently being studied and worked upon to make them safe and secure for the upcoming expected growth of UAVs in civilian airspace. These efforts resulted in services such as Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) or U-space in Europe, providing services to regularize and organize (pre-flight), monitor/track (during the flight) drones in civilian airspace while avoiding collisions. The primary source of information for tracking drones during flight is GPS positioning data, which is used and filtered (after being fused with the other sensors' data) by the flight controller software to estimate the vehicle position, velocity, and orientation. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which is used in most open-source flight controllers such as PX4, is responsible for doing this estimation. This makes EKF a critical component of the whole system. This paper aims to study the reliability of flight controllers and their core component, namely EKF, in the presence of GPS-related failures. To do so, we injected faults (i.e., we emulated failures indeed) on GPS raw data ranging from small noises to complete failure (missing GPS signals) and GPS spoofing to study their impact on EKF estimation and on the system as a whole. We observed that for small faults (e.g., Fixed Small Noise or Freeze Values), EKF is efficient and can tolerate/compensate the faults, whereas there is a gap in the filter for handling bigger anomalies (e.g., Invalid Values or Random Values) in the GPS data. Our research also clearly demonstrates that GPS faults lasting 30 seconds or more have a noticeable effect, which represents a clear vulnerability since GPS can be subject of cyber attacks such as spoofing. The quantification of the impact of GPS-related failures in the PX4 is an essential step to measure and improve the reliability of UAVs' flight controller software."
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9771497/,Initial Reliability Assessment of a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf GPS Sensor for Generic UAVs,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gathered much attention commercially in recent times owing to the advancement in technology, such as the introduction of brushless-DC motors and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). As a result, these UAVs can undertake complex missions and pose potential benefits to a multitude of use cases, for instance, last-mile cargo delivery, infrastructure inspection, and even search-and-rescue missions. With the increase in the adoption of UAVs and the abundance of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components, the airworthiness of the UAVs grows to be of concern as the assessment criteria for them are not as stringent as that of manned aircraft, largely due to the absence of an onboard pilot or passengers. In addition, UAVs with COTS components lack data to provide assurance of their reliability and determine if the UAVs are fit to fly. On-board navigational sensors are one of the critical subsystems in a UAV and any deterioration in the performance of these sensors can precipitate into a UAV system failure during flight missions, potentially leading to a crash. As such, the reliability of these sensors has to be ascertained before any flight mission to ensure their airworthiness. In this paper, we will assess a COTS GPS sensor that has been commonly used in self-assembled UAVs and predict its reliability based on the characteristics of the Surface Mounted Devices (SMD) and Integrated Circuits (IC) using MIL-HDBK-217F. Results from this assessment will provide a preliminary representation of the reliability of a typical COTS GPS sensor for the determination of its suitability for its intended operation."
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9020894/,RSS-Based Q-Learning for Indoor UAV Navigation,"In this paper, we focus on the potential use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for search and rescue (SAR) missions in GPS-denied indoor environments. We consider the problem of navigating a UAV to a wireless signal source, e.g., a smartphone or watch owned by a victim. We assume that the source periodically transmits RF signals to nearby wireless access points. Received signal strength (RSS) at the UAV, which is a function of the UAV and source positions, is fed to a Q-learning algorithm, and the UAV is navigated to the vicinity of the source. Unlike the traditional location-based Q-learning approach that uses the GPS coordinates of the agent, our method uses the RSS to define the states and rewards of the algorithm. It does not require any a priori information about the environment. These, in turn, make it possible to use the UAVs in indoor SAR operations. Two indoor scenarios with different dimensions are created using a ray tracing software. Then, the corresponding heat maps that show the RSS at each possible UAV location are extracted for more realistic analysis. Performance of the RSS-based Q-learning algorithm is compared with the baseline (location-based) Q-learning algorithm in terms of convergence speed, average number of steps per episode, and the total length of the final trajectory. Our results show that the RSS-based Q-learning provides competitive performance with the location-based Q-learning."
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10131699/,Methods of Automating Power Swapping Mechanisms for Extending UAV Flight Missions,"This paper describes a novel complete system for the autonomous replacement of lithium-polymer batteries (LiPo battery) in small-scale unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A core mechanic of the system relies on a horizontal rotating battery chamber that is capable of storing, managing, and distributing eight drone-compliant batteries. The station dubbed the ""Battery Vending Machine"", or BVM for short is accompanied by solar power panels for a rapid power supply, detachable modules for mobile transport, and interlocking components to safeguard the batteries when not in use. Companion modules work with the BVM to allow compatibility with drone docking and battery swapping. A ground control station (GCS) with intricately placed fiducial markers and fast wireless charging technology operates to dock the drone safely in preparation for a power supply hot-swap procedure. A robotic arm system works to transfer the batteries from one station to another. The three stations work in unison to provide a faster and more optimized method to exchange depleted batteries on a flight vehicle with fully charged power sources. Results of physical experiments of each module in the automatic replacement system provide insight into the implementation of high-endurance fully-autonomous flight missions using remote landing, replenishing, and takeoff sequences."
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10749408/,Electromagnetic Locking/Releasing System for UAVs Wireless Charging Stations,"A drone is an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) controlled from the ground by an operator. These vehicles have been under strong development in the last decade both for civil/commercial (surveillance of overhead power lines, territory mapping, fast transports over short distances, PV power plant supervision, fertilizer spreading in agriculture etc.) and military purposes. A main feature of these drones is their action range. This feature is limited by the weight and capacity of the current batteries, which is why it is necessary to recharge them frequently. So far, in-flight battery charging or quick automatic battery swapping on the ground have not been applied. Instead, ground charging is used through conductive technology with galvanic contact or wireless technology. Galvanic contact is affected by difficult atmospheric conditions (wind, rain, snow, mud). This paper presents a novel electromagnetic system that is able to lock the drone on the charging station during wireless charging and to release it at the end of the process."

Electric UAVs are commonly limited by low range and flight endurance, limiting the capabilities of an operator and affecting their mission. Increasing these parameters would allow a UAV to operate in both surveillance and inspection roles for extended periods of time in civilian and military capacities. Additionally, by combining the flight characteristics of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft with the hovering ability of a quadcopter, a UAV can become vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capable and can maneuver over points of interest more precisely. An off-the-shelf quadcopter and airplane are to be extensively modified by the team to create the hybrid craft, with structural batteries replacing conventional wing spars, solar cells replacing the upper wing skins, and wireless induction coils replacing the lower wing skins. A power management system will be used to efficiently control battery usage and balance generated power from flight along power distribution lines and robotic recharging stations with expended power from flight operations. These ground stations will be built to remotely swap drained batteries with fresh replacements, with the aircraft automatically returning to recharge, then launching again to resume autonomous flight."

This paper builds a test environment, in which we verify that the system is stable, reliable, and highly feasible."
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9148458/,A Dynamic Cluster Head Selecting Algorithm for UAV Ad Hoc Networks,"Earthquake is a frequent natural disaster, and the rescue after earthquake is more difficult than those after other disasters because earthquake destroys the ground as well as the communication facilities on it. In this case, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a good choice for survivals searching, and Ad hoc networks are a possible means for communication. As a combination, UAV Ad hoc networks play an important role in emergency rescue and communication system. However, UAV networks are unstable and resource limited, including energy resources and communication resources. The cluster heads in a clustered UAV network are more fragile to these disadvantages. In order to balance the cluster head selecting ratio and decline the collision probability, this paper proposes a dynamic cluster head selecting algorithm based on energy, mobility, distance, and node correlation degree. The algorithm calculates the weights of the UAVs according to the above-mentioned four parameters, and selects the best cluster heads. According to simulation results, the proposed algorithm declines the cluster head changing ratio and improves the packet delivery ratio."
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9888714/,Android and Desktop Based Ground Control Station (GCS) Interface Design for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Communication and Monitoring,"The Indonesian Flying Robot Contest (KRTI) is a competition organized by the National Achievement Center of the Indonesian Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology. One of the KRTI categories, Technology Development, competes with the work of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology in the field of Ground Control Station (GCS). GCS serves to communicate and monitor the condition of the UAV in the air. Generally, GCS is only available in applications designed specifically for certain brands of UAVs, resulting in GCS not being able to be used for other types of UAVs. UAVs can experience wind disturbances as well as urgency due to depleted battery capacity. Based on the problems that have been outlined, in this research, a solution was created to design the interface of an Android and Windows-based GCS application for the communication and monitoring of UAVs. The built GCS provides an alternative communication medium with Radio Telemetry for long-distance coverage and Wi-Fi for short-range coverage. The constructed GCS analyzes the roll value movement of the IMU sensor with the linear regression method to inform the UAV stability condition and analyzes the data of GPS sensors, altitude sensors, and UAV battery capacity sensors with the fuzzy inference system method to inform the urgency of the UAV return time. GCS meets real-time needs running on the lowest versions of Windows 10 and Android 5.0 (Lollipop) with an average data runtime of 3.427 milliseconds for Windows and 16.724 milliseconds for Android. The usability of the GCS design is rated Excellent with an effectiveness rate of 84%.
